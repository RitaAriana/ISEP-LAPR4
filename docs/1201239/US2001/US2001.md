US2001 - As Warehouse Employee, I want to set up the warehouse plant by uploading a JSON file.
=======================================

# 1. Requisitos

**As a Warehouse Employee, I want to set up the warehouse plant by uploading a JSON file.**

### 1.1 Especificações comunicadas pelo cliente

> [Questão](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15995#p20587): 
> Dear Client, Regarding US2001, should the warehouse employee select from a list the warehouse he wants to set up the plant or should he type, for example, the id of the warehouse he wants to set up the plant?
>> **Resposta**: Within this prototype, for the sake of simplicity, there is only 1 (one) warehouse. Best regards.

> [Questão](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15781#p20356):
Dear client, Regarding the upload of a JSON file, is that file supposed to be stored with the rest of the application and be uploaded every time the 
application runs or should the upload be done only once where the information would all be uploaded to the application database and the JSON file discarded/not stored?
>> **Resposta**: The purpose of uploading a JSON file (US2001) is to set up the warehouse plant information required to the system work properly.\
Once that information is set up, there is no need to repeat the setup process. As so, if a JSON file is found the user might be prompt if (s)he wants to update the information about the warehouse plant. The user might also update the information by re-executing the US2001.\
Yet, it is worth noticing that the JSON file might not be available on all workstations used by warehouse employees.\
As so, persisting warehouse plant data on the database seems to be a good option.

> [Questão](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=15758#p20257):
Dear client,\Regarding the shelves in each row that are part of an aisle, is there a need to differentiate them? If not, how will the AGV know on which shelf to look for a product? Because, as we understood, different products can be placed on a different shelf of the same row, and according to the JSON file provided, each row only states how many shelves it has.\
Our best regards.
>> **Resposta**: Yes! You need to differentiate the shelves in each row of an aisle.\
Recall that "The products’ location in the warehouse, which corresponds to a storage area i.e., the aisle identifier, the row identifier, and the shelf identifier. All these identifiers are numeric."\
As you have noticed, each row states how many shelves it has. As so, if a row states it has 4 shelves, it means that the row shelves are identified as shelf 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the bottom to the top.\
If another row stated it has 3 shelves, it means that such row shelves are identified as shelf 1, 2 and 3 again from the bottom to the top.\
I hope this clarifies your doubt.

Dear Client,\
Does a warehouse always have the same plant or can it have different plants in the future?\
>> **Resposta**: Each warehouse has its own plant and, therefore, plants might vary from one warehouse to another.\
However, any warehouse plant is described by a JSON file according to the data structure described in section 5.2 of the specifications' document.\
On US2001, any JSON file meeting such data structure must be supported.

## 3.4. Testes

**Teste 1:** Verifica se o método sameAs() da class AGVDock funciona propriamente.

	@Test
    void sameAs() {
        AGVDock agvDock = new AGVDockBuilder().withId("1L").withWarehouse(new Warehouse()).withDepth(new Depth()).withAccessibility(new Accessibility()).withBegin(new Begin()).withEnd(new End()).build();
        AGVDock agvDock2 = agvDock;

        assertEquals(true, agvDock.sameAs(agvDock2));
    }

**Teste 2:** Verifica se o método sameAs() da class AGVDock funciona propriamente, para um caso negativo.

    @Test
    void sameAs2() {
        AGVDock agvDock = new AGVDockBuilder().withId("1L").withWarehouse(new Warehouse()).withDepth(new Depth()).withAccessibility(new Accessibility()).withBegin(new Begin()).withEnd(new End()).build();
        AGVDock agvDock2 = null;

        assertEquals(false, agvDock.sameAs(agvDock2));
    }

**Teste 3:** Verifica se o método identity() da class Shelf funciona propriamente.

    @Test
    void identity() {
        ShelfId shelfId = new ShelfId(1L, new Line());
        Shelf shelf = new ShelfBuilder().withId(shelfId).withEmpty(true).build();

        assertEquals(shelfId, shelf.identity());
    }

# 4. Implementação

### Encontra-se demonstrada juntamente com o tópico #5 

# 5. Integração/Demonstração

**Nas seguintes imagens é possível verificar a importação para a BDDAD local as componentes AGVDock, Shelf e Line, provenientes do ficheiro [warehouse1.json]

# 6. Observações
**Durante o desenvolvimento da US, foi necessário rever a forma como as ligações efetuadas na BDDAD eram feitas, o que levou a sucessivas mudanças no código.**
